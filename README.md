# Visualising the DFN Dataset
[The Desert Fireball Network (DFN)](http://fireballsinthesky.com.au/) has a sizeable dataset on the orbits of small bodies in our solar system. With support from the [Curtin HIVE](https://humanities.curtin.edu.au/research/centres-institutes-groups/hive/) in their 2019-2020 summer internship program, a Unity project was created for the DFN group that visualised this dataset in an interactive dynamic environment. The purpose of the project is to create figures for scientific papers and videos for presentations. In the future, it is hoped that the general public can access the project itself so an intuitive understanding of the DFN dataset can be achieved.

The scripts stored in this repository all play a part in operating the Unity project. Documentation for the scripts can be found in the [Wiki of this repository](https://github.com/MitchOSully/Visualising-the-DFN-Dataset/wiki). 

## To do
* Provide a .exe version to download. (Requires setting up an installer).
* Provide a Unity project to download, (without the DFN dataset for IP reasons).

## Images
The image below shows the standard output of the program. The sun is shown in the middle (not to scale) along with the planet orbit lines. Every white dot is a meteoroid in a bound orbit that was detected by the DFN.

Support from the Curtin HIVE allowed us to display the project on a large, curved screen called 'The Cylinder', shown in the below image.
