# Visualising the DFN Dataset
[The Desert Fireball Network (DFN)](http://fireballsinthesky.com.au/) has a sizeable dataset on the orbits of small bodies in our solar system. With support from the [Curtin HIVE](https://humanities.curtin.edu.au/research/centres-institutes-groups/hive/) in their 2019-2020 summer internship program, a Unity project was created for the DFN group that visualised this dataset in an interactive dynamic environment. 

The scripts stored in this repository all play a part in operating the Unity project. Documentation for the scripts can be found in the [Wiki of this repository](https://github.com/MitchOSully/Visualising-the-DFN-Dataset/wiki). 

## To do
* Provide a .exe version to download. (Requires setting up an installer).
* Provide a Unity project to download, (without the DFN dataset ofc).

## Images
The image below shows the standard output of the program. The sun is shown in the middle (not to scale) along with the planet orbit lines. Every white dot is a meteoroid in a bound orbit that was detected by the DFN.

Support from the Curtin HIVE allowed us to display the project on a giant screen they've named 'The Cylinder'. This is shown in the image below.
