# Visualising-the-DFN-Dataset
The Desert Fireball Network (DFN) has a sizeable dataset on the orbits of small bodies in our solar system. As a summer scholarship program with the Curtin HIVE in 2019-2020, a Unity project was created that visualised this dataset in an interactive dynamic environment. The scripts stored in this repository all play a part in operating the visualisaiton.
